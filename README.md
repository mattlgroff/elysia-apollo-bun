Powered by Bun & Elysia & Apollo Server

I wrote an article about making an apollo graphql server with bun [here](https://groff.dev/bun-apollo-graphl-with-elysia/) (coming soon)

## Run Instructions
```bash
bun install
bun src/index.js
```

The Apollo Server should be running on the environment variable `PORT` or `3000` if not set.
